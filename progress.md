# Emmett Hono Adapter Implementation Progress

This file tracks the progress of implementing the `@event-driven-io/emmett-hono` package based on the plan defined in `plan.md`.

## Implementation Plan Status

1.  ✅ **Setup Project Structure:** Create a new package `emmett-hono` within the `src/packages/` directory, mirroring the structure of `emmett-expressjs` and `emmett-fastify`.
    - Created `package.json`.
    - Created `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.build.json`, `tsconfig.eslint.json`.
    - Created `tsup.config.ts`.
    - Installed initial dependencies (`hono`, `@types/node`).
    - Created `src/index.ts`.
2.  ✅ **Write First E2E Test:** Implement the first E2E test scenario (1.1: Basic GET request) from `tests.md`.
    - Created `src/e2e/basicRouting.e2e.spec.ts` with the first test.
3.  ✅ **Define Core Types:** Define basic types like `WebApiSetup` in `src/types.ts`.
    - Created `src/types.ts` with `WebApiSetup`.
4.  ✅ **Implement `getApplication`:** Create the `getApplication` function (`src/application.ts`) to initialize and configure a Hono app.
    - Created `src/application.ts` with basic `getApplication`.
5.  ✅ **Implement ETag Handling:** Create ETag functions (`src/etag.ts`).
    - Created `src/etag.ts` with Hono-specific header handling.
6.  ✅ **Implement Response Helpers:** Create response helper functions (`src/responses.ts`) like `send`.
    - Created `src/responses.ts` with `send`, `sendCreated`, `sendAccepted`, `sendNoContent`, `sendProblem` adapted for Hono.
7.  ✅ **Implement Handler Wrapper (`on`):** Create the `on` handler wrapper and response helpers (`src/handler.ts`).
    - Created `src/handler.ts` with `on` wrapper and response helpers (`OK`, `Created`, etc.).
8.  ✅ **Implement Problem Details Middleware:** Create the error handler generator (`src/middlewares/problemDetailsMiddleware.ts`).
    - Created `src/middlewares/problemDetailsMiddleware.ts` with `problemDetailsHandler`.
9.  ✅ **Implement Testing Helpers:** Create testing helpers (`src/testing/`) similar to `emmett-expressjs`, potentially adapting `ApiSpecification` or creating a Hono-specific version (`HonoApiSpecification`?).
    - Created `src/testing/apiSpecification.ts` and `src/testing/index.ts` for Hono.
    - Updated E2E test to use new helpers and confirmed passing.
10. ⏳ **Write E2E Tests (In Progress):** Implementing the E2E tests defined in `tests.md`.

11. ⬜ **Refine and Document:** Refactor code, add documentation (JSDoc/TSDoc), and ensure consistency with other Emmett packages.

## Current Focus: Final Refinement and Documentation

We've successfully completed all the planned test scenarios for the Emmett Hono adapter! The adapter now provides comprehensive integration with Emmett's event sourcing capabilities.

The Command Handling Integration tests demonstrate the adapter's ability to:

1. Execute commands and store events in the event store
2. Implement optimistic concurrency with ETag headers
3. Handle concurrency failures with proper error responses
4. Transform business logic errors into appropriate HTTP responses

The tests use a simple counter domain model to verify these capabilities, with commands for creating and incrementing counters.

With all the planned functionality implemented and tested, we can now focus on refining the code, improving documentation, and ensuring consistency with other Emmett adapters.

## Key Challenges Addressed

1. Fixed TypeScript linter errors around types in error handling
2. Properly implemented RFC 7807 Problem Details middleware
3. Fixed ConcurrencyError and NotFoundError handling with proper constructor parameters
4. Ensured custom error mappers work correctly with ProblemDocument objects
5. Implemented CORS middleware with configurable options
6. Implemented automatic ETag generation middleware with proper rules for when to apply ETags
7. Implemented request logging middleware with customizable formatters and output options
8. Created a simple domain model (counter) for testing command handling
9. Implemented robust command handling with optimistic concurrency via ETags
10. Ensured proper error transformation for different error types

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. Refine code and fix remaining TypeScript linter errors
2. Add comprehensive JSDoc/TSDoc to all public functions and types
3. Ensure consistent naming and patterns with other Emmett adapters
4. Create README documentation for the adapter

1. ✅ Complete HTTP method handlers (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

7. ✅ RFC 7807 Problem Details error handling with support for Emmett error types
8. ✅ CORS middleware support
9. ✅ ETag middleware with automatic ETag generation for responses
10. ✅ Request logging middleware with customizable formatting and output options
